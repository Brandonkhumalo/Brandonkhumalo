  I am an entry-level mobile and backend developer with expertise in Java for Android development and Django for backend systems. I have been actively building projects  to sharpen my skills.  My top skills include mobile app development, backend API integration, and problem-solving. What sets me apart is my ability to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications while continuously learning and adapting to new technologies. 

  I am eager to contribute to a team where I can apply my skills to develop high-quality applications that improve user experiences and streamline business processes. My strong work ethic, quick learning ability, and commitment to writing clean, maintainable code make me a valuable asset.
